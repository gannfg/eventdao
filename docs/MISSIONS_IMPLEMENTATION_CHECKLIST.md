## üìã Testing Checklist

### Database Testing
```sql
-- Test 1: Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('missions', 'user_missions', 'mission_completions', 'evt_transactions', 'referrals');

-- Test 2: Check missions were inserted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM missions;
-- Should return: 7

-- Test 3: Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('missions', 'user_missions', 'evt_transactions');

-- Test 4: Test claim_mission_reward function exists
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'claim_mission_reward';
```

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/account` page
- [ ] Verify 7 missions are displayed
- [ ] Click "Start" on a mission - should open external link
- [ ] Click "Claim Reward" on completed mission - should update EVT
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test on tablet
- [ ] Test with slow network

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Sign up new user
- [ ] Verify missions are initialized
- [ ] Complete a mission
- [ ] Claim reward
- [ ] Verify EVT balance updated
- [ ] Check transaction recorded
- [ ] Test referral link
- [ ] Sign up with referral link
- [ ] Verify referral created
- [ ] Test daily login bonus

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Missions Not Loading
```typescript
// Check if missions service is working
import { missionService } from '@/lib/mission-service';

const missions = await missionService.getAllMissions();
console.log('Missions:', missions);
```

### Rewards Not Crediting
```sql
-- Check if function exists
SELECT claim_mission_reward('user-uuid'::uuid, 'mission-uuid'::uuid);

-- Check transaction log
SELECT * FROM evt_transactions 
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### RLS Policy Issues
```sql
-- Check current user
SELECT auth.uid();

-- Test policy
SELECT * FROM user_missions WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Total missions completed per day
- EVT credits distributed per day
- Most popular missions
- Average time to claim rewards
- Daily active users
- Referral conversion rate
- Mission completion rate

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Daily mission completions
SELECT mission_key, COUNT(*) as completions
FROM mission_completions
WHERE completion_date = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY mission_key;

-- Total EVT distributed today
SELECT SUM(reward_earned) as total_evt
FROM mission_completions
WHERE completion_date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Top earners this week
SELECT u.username, u.total_evt_earned
FROM users u
ORDER BY u.total_evt_earned DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Referral statistics
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_referrals,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE reward_given = true) as rewarded
FROM referrals;
```
